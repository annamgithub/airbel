      * Mobilizers have good relationships with their households and are seen by
      caregivers as partners in problem-solving around adoption of positive
      practices.

      * Some positive practices, such as purchasing fruit (all of which is
      imported in Niger) and buying soap remains difficult due to the communal
      nature of resource consumption in the villages.

      * Sprout doubles the amount of cash distributed to $10.43 USD every 2
      weeks to see how that affects food diversification and hand hygiene
      practices.

      * Mobilizers recommend further improvements to the activities.

      * In Community C, the community warehouse was renovated to better protect
      against rodents, insects, and leaks. A community warehouse management
      committee was convened and trained on warehouse management protocols. The
      community suggested an appropriate fee for warehouse storage. The fee goes
      into a fund that is then paid out to caregivers of children until 36
      months and pregnant women.

      * Cash distribution and household visits by mobilizers begin in
      Communities A and B.

      * Twenty caregivers of children under 36 months in each participating
      village were selected by the community to participate in the Sprout
      prototype based on the communities definition of “most vulnerable.”

      * Bi-weekly unconditional cash distribution of the equivalent of $5.22 USD
      was decided upon based on the average cost of adopting 2-3 new positive
      practices per week and the typical cash spending practices in the
      communities. The cash is intended to trigger adoption or intensification
      of positive practices.

      * Airbel designers and community mobilizers worked to design and refine
      activities that mobilizers will use during bi-weekly household visits to
      promote positive practices, document their frequency over time, track food
      consumption of children and families, and track cash use.

      * Three villages were selected for participation in the Tillaberi region
      of Niger. One of those villages has an existing community warehouse used
      for storing food aid from the government and NGOs.

      * Two community mobilizers per village worked to get to know their
      community members and build trust with community leaders and caregivers.
      The mobilizers observed which practices caregivers use for promoting
      healthy child growth and with the help of IRC nutrition specialists,
      identified 19 positive practices for Sprout to promote.

      Developed a prototype to understand how post-harvest loss reduction, small
      cash transfers, and promotion of locally-relevant positive practices meets
      user preferences and can support adoption of SAM risk-reduction actions.

      understand:

        * What advice do they have for raising healthy children?
        * What actions would they like to be able to take and what would they need to do it?
      * Consulted providers in SAM-affected areas to understand the local
      drivers of SAM

      their priorities, interests, and current investments in caring for their
      children

      * Conducted observations in clinics to observe interactions between
      providers and caregivers to understand current practices and opportunities
      for prevention

      * Developed a model to analyze interactions between innovations under
      various scenarios with input from nutrition experts (users can manipulate
      the model to change assumptions as they like)

Current malnutrition prevention efforts range from breastfeeding exclusively to multi-pronged approaches that include a dizzying number of interventions like home gardens, cash transfers, and feeding practices all together. But none have proven to be effective and scalable prevention methods.

To pinpoint the most impactful methods, Sprout is experimenting with 3 distinct approaches:

1. **Positive Practices:** Identifying and promoting existing practices in communities, like hand washing and diversifying the foods children eat, that are associated with SAM prevention, and then introducing choices for additional, relevant practices that women can decide to adopt. Supporting women in changing their ability, motivation, and opportunity to adopt or intensify positive practices.
2. **Post-Harvest Loss:** Offering an alternative service to current storage practices that better protects against losses of crops from rodents, insects, and fungus; and may offset the cost of operations.
3. **Cash:** Providing modest quantities of unconditional cash to pregnant women and caregivers of children under 3 years to prompt the uptake of new behaviors, like eating (rather than selling) eggs or buying soap.
