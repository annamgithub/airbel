  A third of the 2 billion people who are micronutrient deficient are children.
  Many have little access to diverse foods or supplements. By working through
  private sector supply chains, this product will expand micronutrient access to
  caregivers in an easy-to-use form that mimics bouillon.

Two billion people are affected by micronutrient deficiencies worldwide, contributing to anemia, loss of eyesight, diarrhea, and disrupted or delayed mental and physical development. One third of those affected are children under the age of five. In some parts of the world, especially those impacted by conflict, it can be difficult or impossible for caregivers to find or afford micronutrient-rich foods like fruit, vegetables, fortified foods, and animal protein.

Micronutrient powder (MNP), a white, odorless, tasteless powder, is sometimes distributed freely through health centers or available through socially-marketed products like Sprinkles. These products face major challenges due to limited or irregular availability, and confusion by end users who may not be well informed about how and why to use the powder. This is particularly true in conflict-affected areas where health services are already over-burdened, and therefore cannot provide substantial preventative services or support to caregivers.

Bouillon cubes are frequently used in many parts of the world a flavoring base to most foods. Working with bouillon manufacturers, whose products are already part of people’s daily lives, this solution would introduce micronutrient cubes mimicking the shape and use of a bouillon cube. These cube-shaped micronutrient doses would be sold through the existing bouillon supply chain, branded for children 6-24 months, and designed to be added to the pot at the start of cooking a child’s porridge.

Drawing upon the creativity and resilience of last-mile vendors, introducing micronutrients through the bouillon supply chain could side-step the logistical and monetary challenges faced by humanitarian agencies and ensure better access and uptake by caregivers.
